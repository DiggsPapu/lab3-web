                <h3>Devil</h3>
                <p>The devil can be presented in a lot of ways, even though, at the beginning can seem pleasant we should be always aware that it can show up at any time.</p>
                <em>In this world, is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law? Is it like the hand of God hovering above? At least, it is true that man has no control, even over his own will.</em>
