                <h3>Courage</h3>
                <p>Courage is defined as the ability to do something frightening or strength in the face of pain or grief, but being courageous is more than being fearless or strong. At Leadership Vision, we believe courage begins with a humble acceptance of self. It's the courage to accept who you are and how you engage with the world around you. Courage is both an expression in a moment and also a knowledge over time. It evolves, matures, and becomes more observant. Courage is the expression of your true identity.</p>
                <h3>Being prepared</h3>
                <p>We must be prepared for anything, in case something that we didn't expected showed up. We must be alert at all times because evil always show up when we don't expect it to do it.</p>
