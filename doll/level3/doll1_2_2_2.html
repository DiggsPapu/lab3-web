            <p>Mollity heard a lot of barking, it was a pack of 12 or more dogs, they were searching for food.</p>
            <p>Those dogs were aproaching to her safety and even though she wasn't a human, she started to feel something close to that feeling. If she'd have had a heart, it would have been beating really fast.</p>
            <p>Any false move could mean, maybe not her death but something worse. Last time, she needed more than a few years to heal from an attack like it.</p>
            <p>Those dogs were closer and her plastic heart was beating harder, she felt that her plastic heart could be heard all over the street.</p>
            <p>One of those dogs started to rip the little box and she was so terrified of what could happen next...</p>
